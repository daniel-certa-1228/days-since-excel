# Days Since Dan Forgot 📊😤

A monument to accountability. A shrine to memory. A passive-aggressive masterpiece.

## What is this?

This is a beautifully crafted, single-page website dedicated to tracking the number of days since Dan last forgot to update the Excel Export. Because apparently, this is a thing that happens. Repeatedly.

## Why does this exist?

Because Slack reminders weren't cutting it. Because sticky notes can be ignored. Because sometimes you need a URL you can passive-aggressively drop in the team chat when Dan inevitably asks "wait, did I forget something?"

Yes, Dan. Yes you did.

## Features

- ✨ **Big Numbers** - So big you can see them from across the office
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** - Track Dan's forgetfulness on any device
- 🎨 **Gradient Background** - Because even public shaming deserves good design
- ⏰ **Auto-updates** - Refreshes every hour, like your disappointment
- 🔥 **Zero Dependencies** - Just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Like Dan's excuses: simple and ineffective.

## How to Use

### Deployment
1. Upload `days-since.html` to your web hosting service, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or wherever
2. Send the link to everyone except Dan
3. Wait

### When Dan Inevitably Forgets Again

1. Open `days-since.html` in any text editor
2. Find this line:
   ```javascript
   const LAST_INCIDENT_DATE = '2025-01-15';
   ```
3. Update the date to today's date (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`)
4. Commit and push
5. Send the link to Dan
6. Repeat in 2-3 weeks

## FAQ

**Q: Will this actually help Dan remember?**  
A: Probably not. But it'll make the rest of us feel better.

**Q: Isn't this a bit mean?**  
A: Dan literally forgot to update the Excel Export. Again. So... no.

**Q: What if Dan never forgets again?**  
A: We'll update this README when pigs fly and Dan remembers his tasks consistently.

**Q: Can I fork this for my own forgetful coworker?**  
A: Absolutely. Spread the accountability.

## Technical Details

For those who care (looking at you, Dan, who should be updating that Export instead of reading this):

- Pure vanilla JavaScript
- CSS3 gradients and flexbox
- Calculates days since midnight of the incident date
- Counter updates automatically every hour
- Works in all modern browsers (and probably IE11, but we don't talk about that)

## Contributing

Found a bug? Have a suggestion for more passive-aggressive features? PRs welcome!

Suggestion for Dan: Maybe contribute by actually updating the Excel Export on time? Just a thought.

## License

MIT License - Because unlike Excel Exports, this should be free and accessible to all.
